For anyone that enjoys a visit to a brewery, it is likely that the thought of one day opening a brewery of one's own is tantalizing. There are certainly many decisions that would need to be made when pursuing this idea. One of the simplest and most straightforward is trying to decide on a location. There are a few assumptions that I have made for this project. First,is that it would be desirable to join a brewery district - which assumes that people that like brewerys are already drawn to a an area that has brewerys and it is easier to lure them a couple of blocks than to travel to a completely different area. The second is that some brewery districts are better than others and that it would be better to be the worst brewery in the most popular area, than the most popular brewery in the least popular area. Third, brewerys tend draw locals more frequently than visitors and locals with more money are likely to spend more money.

For this project, I will first identify the brewery districts within the greater Washington DC and Baltimore area. This will be based upon my own made up defintion of having a minimum of two breweries within walking distance - which I will define as 20 minute walk.

Next, I will define the popularity of each district, by ranking them against eachother. 

I will then identify the neighboorhood and average home value and rank them against eachother.

Finally, I will combine these two rankings to determine which 'district' would be the best place to open another brewery.
